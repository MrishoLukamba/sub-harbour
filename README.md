**Notes on development workflow**

* Please make sure you start your own branch and name it starting with your name initials following with what is being implemented i.e ml-offchain-workers
* Make sure we use cargo fmt
* Inline documentation is a must as it will enable a fellow colleague to understand what you are implementing and testing it.
* We should also test our pallets , but testing should not slow our development. As anyone can test other colleague's pallet.
* Branch pre-main will be used to merge our branch and do intergration test on our pallets and to try to run our node 
* We submit our main branch to the hackathon after being testedm inside pre-main branch

**Note on foreign work**
* Lets not forget to include reference if we used someone's work

**We will be tracking our progress inside Notion**
